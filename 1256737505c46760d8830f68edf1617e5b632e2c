Multi-layered testing strategy: Architecture tests validate public API contracts before implementation. Property-based tests (proptest) for complex logic like SearchFilter, RRF fusion. Functional tests for end-to-end workflows. tempfile crate excellent for test isolation. Establish benchmark baselines from day 1.
