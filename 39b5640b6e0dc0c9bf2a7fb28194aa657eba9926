**Prompt Storage by Domain Scope**

Prompts are stored in the persistence backend configured for each domain:
- **Project scope**: Git notes (repo-specific, travels with the codebase)
- **User scope**: Local storage (SQLite/filesystem in ~/.config/subcog or similar)
- **Org scope**: Shared storage (PostgreSQL or organizational backend)

This aligns with the three-layer storage architecture where different domains may have different persistence backends. The PromptService must route save/get/list/delete operations to the appropriate backend based on domain scope.
