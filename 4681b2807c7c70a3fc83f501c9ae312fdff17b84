Hooks don't parse assistant output for memory blocks. The `▶ subcog://` markers in responses are visual-only - no hook has transcript access to auto-capture them. Stop hook only captures `final_summary` from structured JSON input. Fix options: (1) Stop hook parses `transcript` field if Claude Code provides it, (2) New PostAssistantMessage hook, (3) Client-side parsing by Claude Code calling MCP capture. Currently users must manually capture via MCP tools.
