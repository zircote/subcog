Performance anti-patterns identified in code review: (1) O(n²) duplicate detection - fix with batch loading + LSH for approximate matching, (2) N+1 queries in context building and recall - fix with batch get operations, (3) Sequential embedding generation - parallelize with rayon or tokio, (4) Linear vector search O(n) - must use actual HNSW index for O(log n). Always profile before declaring performance acceptable.
