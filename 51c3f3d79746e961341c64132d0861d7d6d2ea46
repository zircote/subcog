fastembed crate chosen for embedding generation with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (384 dimensions). Benefits: no external API dependency for core features, works offline, single binary (model embedded or cached), fast inference. Trade-offs: model download on first use, fixed model (no custom training), larger binary size. Local embedding generation aligns with local-first philosophy. This is ADR-007.
