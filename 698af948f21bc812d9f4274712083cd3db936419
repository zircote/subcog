Async vs Sync trade-offs in Rust: Tokio enabled but most operations kept synchronous for MVP simplicity. reqwest async HTTP client works well with tokio runtime. Future async migration path clear via trait abstractions. Decision: start with sync operations when complexity isn't justified, but design traits to allow async migration.
