BLOCKER: Failed to capture memories during System Help Memories implementation (SPEC-2025-12-29-001)

**What happened**: Completed 5 phases of implementation work across multiple sessions without a single memory.capture call during the actual work. Only captured retrospectively after user called out the failure.

**Root cause**: Treated memory capture as secondary/optional rather than integrated into workflow. Was focused on "completing tasks" (editing, testing, committing) without following the session behavior protocol.

**Impact**: 
- Lost real-time context and reasoning for decisions
- Retrospective captures are summaries, not authentic in-the-moment insights
- Demonstrates poor practice while literally building the memory system

**Resolution needed**:
1. Make memory.capture a reflex, not an afterthought
2. Capture BEFORE moving to next task, not after completing all work
3. Use the "~1 capture per 3-5 substantive messages" guideline as a minimum
4. The session behavior protocol RULE 0 exists for a reason - follow it
