OpenTelemetry chosen for observability: tracing crate for instrumentation, opentelemetry for OTLP export, tracing-subscriber for formatting, Prometheus endpoint for metrics. Benefits: industry standard, vendor-neutral, excellent Rust support, unified tracing/metrics. Trade-offs: configuration complexity, runtime overhead, large dependency tree. This is ADR-010.
