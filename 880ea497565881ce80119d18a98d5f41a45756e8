Cross-repository deployments should always use PRs instead of direct pushes:

**Rationale:**
- Allows review before deploying to production
- Creates audit trail of changes
- Safer approach for automated workflows
- Prevents accidental overwrites or conflicts
- Enables rollback by reverting the PR

**Implementation pattern for GitHub Actions:**
1. Build artifacts in source repo
2. Create unique branch in target repo (e.g., `docs/subcog-{commit_sha}`)
3. Commit changes to that branch
4. Open PR using `gh pr create`
5. Include source commit link and automated summary in PR body

This applies to: docs deployments, Homebrew formula updates, any workflow that modifies another repository.
