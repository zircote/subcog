usearch chosen for vector similarity search: HNSW algorithm for approximate KNN, single file persistence, 384 dimensions (MiniLM), cosine similarity. Performance: <10ms for 10K vectors, small memory footprint, no external server. Trade-offs: separate file from SQLite, no ACID guarantees (acceptable given git notes as authoritative). This is ADR-008.
