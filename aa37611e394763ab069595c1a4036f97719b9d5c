Git notes chosen as primary persistence layer: Notes attached to commits in refs/notes/mem/{namespace}, YAML front matter for metadata, Markdown body for content, cat-sort-uniq merge strategy. Benefits: built-in version history, free remote sync via git push/pull, works with existing git workflows, no additional infrastructure. Trade-offs: git dependency, performance limits at 10K+ memories, not suitable for multi-user concurrent writes. This is ADR-006.
