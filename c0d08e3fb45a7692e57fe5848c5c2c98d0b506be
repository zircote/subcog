Feature tier system: Tier 1 (Core) - always available, zero external dependencies. Tier 2 (Enhanced) - opt-in, no external services. Tier 3 (LLM-Powered) - requires LLM provider. Users should not be forced to configure LLM just for basic capture/search. Design features with explicit opt-in and graceful degradation.
