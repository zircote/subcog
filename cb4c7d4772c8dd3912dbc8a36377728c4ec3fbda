In collaborative repos, resolve merge conflicts manually rather than using `git reset --hard`. The reset approach assumes single-contributor workflow and could destroy other contributors' uncommitted work or local changes. Proper approach: resolve conflicts file-by-file, or at minimum confirm with the team before discarding local state.
