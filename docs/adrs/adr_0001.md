# ADR-0001: Rust as Implementation Language

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Python implementation of git-notes-memory served as a successful proof-of-concept, achieving 90%+ test coverage and validating the core architecture. However, the Python version has inherent limitations:

- Requires Python runtime, pip, and virtualenv for distribution
- ~500ms+ startup time with model loading
- GIL limitations for true parallelism
- Runtime type errors vs compile-time guarantees

## Decision

We will rewrite the entire system in Rust.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single static binary distribution (<100MB)
- ~10ms cold start (50x improvement)
- True parallelism with async/await (tokio)
- Memory safety via compiler guarantees
- Predictable memory usage (no GC pauses)
- Type safety at compile time

### Negative

- Longer initial development time
- Steeper learning curve
- Smaller ecosystem for some AI/ML libraries
- Compilation time for development iteration

## Decision Outcome

The performance and distribution benefits outweigh the development overhead. The Python POC validated the architecture, so the Rust rewrite can focus on implementation quality rather than architectural exploration.

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Rust crate and binaries defined for Subcog | `Cargo.toml` | L1-L22 | compliant |

**Summary:** Rust crate and binaries confirm the implementation language decision.

**Action Required:** None
