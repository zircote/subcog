# ADR-0005: URN Scheme for Memory Addressing

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Memories need unique, stable identifiers that:

- Work across domains (project, user, org)
- Are human-readable
- Support MCP resource addressing
- Enable linking between memories

## Decision

We will adopt the URN scheme: `subcog://mem/{domain}/{namespace}/{id}`

Examples:

- `subcog://mem/project:my-app/decisions/abc1234:0`
- `subcog://mem/user/learnings/def5678:1`
- `subcog://mem/org:acme-corp/patterns/ghi9012:0`

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent addressing across interfaces
- MCP resource compatibility
- Human-readable format
- Domain hierarchy encoded
- Supports URI parsing libraries

### Negative

- Longer than simple IDs
- Encoding required for special characters
- Version not encoded (may need extension)

## Decision Outcome

The URN scheme provides a foundation for MCP resources and future API extensions. The format is intuitive and parseable.
