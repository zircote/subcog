# ADR-0010: OpenTelemetry for Observability

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system requires comprehensive observability:

- Distributed tracing
- Metrics collection
- Structured logging
- OTLP export

## Decision

We will use the OpenTelemetry ecosystem:

- `tracing` crate for instrumentation
- `opentelemetry` for OTLP export
- `tracing-subscriber` for formatting
- Prometheus endpoint for metrics

## Consequences

### Positive

- Industry standard
- Vendor-neutral
- Excellent Rust support
- Unified tracing/metrics

### Negative

- Configuration complexity
- Runtime overhead
- Large dependency tree

## Decision Outcome

OpenTelemetry is the industry standard for observability. The Rust ecosystem has mature support through the tracing family of crates.

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| OpenTelemetry tracing layers and exporters configured | `src/observability/tracing.rs` | L5-L14 | compliant |

**Summary:** OpenTelemetry SDK and OTLP exporters are wired into observability.

**Action Required:** None
