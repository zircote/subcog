# ADR-0015: Token Budget for Injected Memories

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Injecting too many memories or too much content can overwhelm the assistant's context and slow processing. We need to limit injected content.

## Decision

We will implement a **token budget** with content truncation:

- Default: 4000 tokens for injected memories
- Memory content truncated to ~200 chars for preview
- Full content available via memory URN if needed

## Consequences

### Positive

- Prevents context bloat
- Consistent injection size
- Memory URN provides access to full content

### Negative

- Truncation may hide important details
- Fixed budget may not be optimal for all cases

### Neutral

- Budget configurable via `max_tokens`
