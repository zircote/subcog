# ADR-0016: Confidence Threshold for Injection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Not all detected intents should trigger memory injection. Very low confidence detections may inject irrelevant memories.

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. **Noise Reduction**: Low-confidence detections often add irrelevant memories that distract from the task at hand.

2. **User Experience**: Users expect memory injection to be helpful, not overwhelming or off-topic.

3. **Configurability**: Different environments and use cases may require different sensitivity levels.

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. **Graduated Response**: Higher confidence should unlock more aggressive memory injection.

2. **Logging Transparency**: Even low-confidence detections should be logged for debugging and tuning.

## Decision

We will use a **configurable confidence threshold** (default 0.5):

- Confidence < 0.5: No memory injection, signal still logged
- Confidence >= 0.5: Inject memories, include reminder
- Confidence >= 0.8: Inject more memories (max_count)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduces false positive injections
- Threshold can be tuned per environment
- Graduated response based on confidence

### Negative

- May miss valid intents at threshold boundary
- Default may not be optimal for all users

### Neutral

- Threshold exposed in configuration

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Always Inject on Any Detection

**Description**: Inject memories whenever any intent is detected, regardless of confidence level.

**Advantages**: Simple implementation, maximum recall.

**Disadvantages**: Low-confidence detections add noise and reduce signal-to-noise ratio.

### Option 2: User-Configurable Per Session

**Description**: Allow users to configure the threshold dynamically during each session.

**Advantages**: Maximum flexibility for users.

**Disadvantages**: Too complex for MVP (deferred for future enhancement).

### Option 3: Configurable Threshold with Graduated Response (Selected)

**Description**: Use a configurable threshold (default 0.5) with graduated response levels.

**Advantages**: Balances noise reduction with useful recall, configurable per environment.

**Disadvantages**: Default threshold may not be optimal for all users.

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Confidence threshold checked before context assembly | `src/hooks/search_context.rs` | L349-L353 | compliant |

**Summary:** Injection is gated by a configurable confidence threshold (default 0.5).

**Action Required:** None
