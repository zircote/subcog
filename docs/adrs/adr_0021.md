# ADR-0021: Fail-Open on Deduplication Errors

## Status

Accepted

## Context

What should happen if a deduplication check fails? Options: fail closed (block capture), fail open (allow capture), or skip with warning.

## Decision

We will fail open - if deduplication checks fail, proceed with capture and log a warning.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Prioritizes data capture over duplicate prevention
- Aligns with existing hook error handling philosophy
- Temporary failures don't block important captures
- Consolidation service can clean up duplicates later

### Negative

- May capture duplicates during service degradation
- Errors might go unnoticed if only logged at warn level

### Neutral

- Metrics will show elevated capture counts during failures
