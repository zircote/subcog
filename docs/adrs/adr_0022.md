# ADR-0022: Semantic Check Minimum Length

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Very short content (<50 chars) produces poor embeddings and is cheap to store. Should we run semantic checks on short content?

## Decision

We will skip semantic similarity check for content shorter than 50 characters. Only use exact match and recent capture for short content.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Avoids noisy embeddings from short phrases
- Saves embedding computation cost
- Short duplicates caught by exact match anyway

### Negative

- Very short content with slight variations won't be caught by semantic check
- Threshold is somewhat arbitrary

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Length gate skips semantic check below min_semantic_length | `src/services/deduplication/semantic.rs` | L153-L160 | compliant |

**Summary:** Semantic checks are skipped for short content.

**Action Required:** None
