# ADR-0027: Full Enrichment Scope

## Status

Accepted

## Context

What should the LLM generate for enrichment?

- Description only
- Description + defaults
- Full enrichment (description, required, default, validation hints)

## Decision

We will use **full enrichment** for both variables and prompt-level metadata.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Rich, usable frontmatter from first save
- Variables are self-documenting
- Reduces manual editing

### Negative

- Larger LLM response to parse
- More fields that could be wrong
- Higher token cost

### Mitigation

- User can edit generated frontmatter
- User-provided values are preserved (not overwritten)
