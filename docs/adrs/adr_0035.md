# ADR-0035: Score Normalization to 0.0-1.0 Range

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current RRF implementation produces scores in the range 0.0-0.033 (approximately). Users expect scores in 0.0-1.0 range where higher means more relevant.

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. **User Intuition**: Users expect scores between 0.0-1.0, with 1.0 being most relevant
2. **Ordering Preservation**: Normalization must preserve relative ordering of results
3. **Simplicity**: The normalization method should be easy to understand and implement

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. **Debugging Support**: Raw scores should remain accessible for power users
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Single-result and empty-result queries need sensible behavior
3. **Documentation**: Normalization behavior should be clearly documented

## Considered Options

### Option 1: No Normalization

**Description**: Return raw RRF scores.

**Advantages**:
- Comparable across queries
- Stable values

**Disadvantages**:
- Unintuitive scores (0.0-0.033 range)
- Users confused by low numbers

### Option 2: Linear Normalization (Selected)

**Description**: Scale to 0.0-1.0 based on maximum score in result set.

**Advantages**:
- Intuitive scores
- Top result always 1.0
- Preserves ordering

**Disadvantages**:
- Not comparable across queries
- May mask quality differences

### Option 3: Min-Max Normalization

**Description**: Scale based on both min and max scores.

**Advantages**:
- Uses full 0.0-1.0 range

**Disadvantages**:
- Not comparable across queries
- Unstable (small changes shift all scores)

### Option 4: Sigmoid Normalization

**Description**: Apply sigmoid function to compress scores.

**Advantages**:
- Stable transformation

**Disadvantages**:
- Sort of intuitive but not quite
- Harder to explain to users

### Option 5: Percentile Normalization

**Description**: Convert to percentile rank.

**Advantages**:
- Intuitive as "top N%"

**Disadvantages**:
- Not comparable across queries
- Unstable ordering

## Decision

We will use **linear normalization** based on maximum score in result set.

```rust
fn normalize(results: &[SearchHit]) -> Vec<SearchResult> {
    let max = results.iter().map(|r| r.score).fold(0.0, f32::max);
    results.iter().map(|r| SearchResult {
        score: if max > 0.0 { r.score / max } else { 0.0 },
        raw_score: r.score,
    }).collect()
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Users see intuitive 0.0-1.0 scores
- Top result always scores 1.0 (if results exist)
- Preserves relative ordering

### Negative

- Scores not comparable across queries
- May mask quality differences (if best match is poor)
- Single-result queries always show 1.0

### Neutral

- Within-query relevance is clear and intuitive
- Power users can access raw scores via `--raw` flag

## Options Comparison

| Option | Intuitive | Comparable | Stable |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Raw | No | Yes | Yes |
| Linear | Yes | No* | Yes |
| Min-max | Yes | No | No |
| Sigmoid | Sort of | No | Yes |
| Percentile | Yes | No | No |

*Linear normalization means scores aren't comparable across different queries, but within a query they're intuitive.

## Decision Outcome

Linear normalization provides best user experience for within-query relevance while preserving ordering.

Mitigations:
- Return `raw_score` alongside `score` for debugging
- Add `--raw` CLI flag for power users
- Document normalization behavior

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| normalize_scores scales max score to 1.0 | `src/services/recall.rs` | L736-L782 | compliant |

**Summary:** Search scores are normalized to the 0.0-1.0 range.

**Action Required:** None
