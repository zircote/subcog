# ADR-0043: No-Op SyncService for User Scope

## Status

Accepted

## Context

User-scope has no git remote to sync with. SyncService must handle this gracefully.

Options considered:
1. Return error when sync called on user scope
2. Return empty success (no-op)
3. Omit SyncService from user-scope container
4. Future: cloud backup sync

## Decision

We will create `SyncService::no_op()` that returns empty success stats.

## Consequences

### Positive

- No special-casing in callers
- Clear intent in method name
- Easy to extend later (can add cloud sync)
- Graceful handling - sync commands don't crash
- Consistent API - ServiceContainer always has SyncService
- User-friendly - no confusing errors for user-scope

### Negative

- Silent no-op might confuse users expecting sync
- Should document this behavior

## Alternatives Considered

- **Return error**: Poor UX for scripts that call sync unconditionally
- **Omit SyncService**: Breaking API change, requires `Option<>` everywhere
- **Cloud sync now**: Out of scope, significant additional work

## Decision Outcome

A no-op implementation maintains API consistency while allowing graceful operation in user-scope contexts.
