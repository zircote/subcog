# ADR-0048: Consolidate to User-Level Storage with Faceting

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current architecture has three storage tiers with complex routing:

```
org/     → Shared PostgreSQL (configured, rarely used)
project/ → Git notes per repo (BROKEN)
user/    → ~/.config/subcog/ (works)
```

This creates several problems:
- Complexity in deciding where to store/retrieve
- Per-repository storage prevents cross-project learning
- Backup and sync story is complicated (3 locations)

## Decision

We will **consolidate to user-level storage with project/branch/path facets**.

- Single storage location:
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/subcog/`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/subcog/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\subcog\`
- Auto-detect facets from git context when capturing
- Query by facets instead of switching storage tiers

Facet fields added to Memory struct:
```rust
pub struct Memory {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub project_id: Option<String>,  // Normalized git remote URL
    pub branch: Option<String>,       // Current branch name
    pub file_path: Option<String>,    // Relative path from repo root
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single location to backup
- Cross-project learning enabled via faceted queries
- Simpler mental model for users
- Reduced codebase complexity

### Negative

- Memories don't automatically travel with repository clones
- Requires careful facet normalization (remote URL variations)

### Neutral

- Org-scope can be added later as a separate configured backend

## Decision Outcome

Consolidated storage with faceting provides the best balance of simplicity, flexibility, and cross-project learning capabilities.

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Violated

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Memory struct lacks project_id/branch/file_path facets | `src/models/memory.rs` | L43-L68 | violation |
| SQLite schema has no facet columns | `src/storage/index/sqlite.rs` | L231-L240 | violation |

**Summary:** Memory model and schema lack project/branch/path facets required by the ADR.

**Action Required:** Add facet fields to Memory and persist them in SQLite, or revise ADR-0048.
