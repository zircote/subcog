# ADR-0050: Fresh Start - No Migration of Legacy Data

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are 645 memories in existing git-notes across various repositories. These were created by earlier tooling (the Python git-notes-memory-manager) that used a different storage approach.

Options considered:
1. Build migration tooling to extract and re-import
2. Provide export-only tooling for manual inspection
3. Fresh start - legacy data remains in git-notes history

## Decision

We will take a **fresh start** - no automatic migration of legacy git-notes data.

Rationale from user:
> "The 645 memories are artifacts from earlier tooling. Fresh start is acceptable."

## Consequences

### Positive

- No complex migration code to build and maintain
- No risk of importing corrupted/duplicate data
- Clean slate with known-good architecture

### Negative

- Historical decisions and learnings not immediately available
- Users must re-capture important memories manually

## Alternatives Considered

- **Build migration tooling**: Complex, risk of data corruption
- **Export-only tooling**: Partial solution, still requires manual effort

## Decision Outcome

Fresh start eliminates migration complexity and ensures data quality from the beginning.

Mitigations:
- Legacy git-notes remain in repository history (not deleted)
- Users can manually review and re-capture high-value memories
- A future "import" command could be added if demand exists

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Migration command focuses on embedding generation | `src/commands/migrate.rs` | L1-L16 | compliant |

**Summary:** Migration tooling targets embeddings only; no legacy git-notes migration is present.

**Action Required:** None
