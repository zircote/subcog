# ADR-0050: Fresh Start - No Migration of Legacy Data

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are 645 memories in existing git-notes across various repositories. These were created by earlier tooling (the Python git-notes-memory-manager) that used a different storage approach.

Options considered:
1. Build migration tooling to extract and re-import
2. Provide export-only tooling for manual inspection
3. Fresh start - legacy data remains in git-notes history

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. **Data Quality**: Migration risks importing corrupted or duplicate data
2. **Development Velocity**: Migration tooling is complex and delays the rewrite
3. **User Acceptance**: User confirmed fresh start is acceptable

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. **Maintenance Burden**: Migration code requires ongoing maintenance
2. **Clean Architecture**: Starting fresh ensures the new architecture is not compromised by legacy constraints

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Selected)

**Description**: No automatic migration. Legacy git-notes data remains in repository history but is not imported.

**Advantages**:
- No complex migration code to build and maintain
- No risk of importing corrupted/duplicate data
- Clean slate with known-good architecture

**Disadvantages**:
- Historical decisions and learnings not immediately available
- Users must re-capture important memories manually

### Option 2: Build Migration Tooling

**Description**: Create tools to extract memories from git-notes and import to SQLite.

**Advantages**:
- Preserves historical data

**Disadvantages**:
- Complex implementation
- Risk of data corruption during migration
- Ongoing maintenance burden

### Option 3: Export-Only Tooling

**Description**: Provide tools to export git-notes to JSON for manual review.

**Advantages**:
- Users can review historical data

**Disadvantages**:
- Still requires manual re-capture effort
- Partial solution

## Decision

We will take a **fresh start** - no automatic migration of legacy git-notes data.

Rationale from user:
> "The 645 memories are artifacts from earlier tooling. Fresh start is acceptable."

## Consequences

### Positive

- No complex migration code to build and maintain
- No risk of importing corrupted/duplicate data
- Clean slate with known-good architecture

### Negative

- Historical decisions and learnings not immediately available
- Users must re-capture important memories manually

### Neutral

- Mitigations available: Legacy git-notes remain in repository history (not deleted); users can manually review and re-capture high-value memories; a future "import" command could be added if demand exists

- **Related ADRs:** [ADR-0039](adr_0039.md) (backward compatibility now moot)

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Migration command focuses on embedding generation | `src/commands/migrate.rs` | L1-L16 | compliant |

**Summary:** Migration tooling targets embeddings only; no legacy git-notes migration is present.

**Action Required:** None
