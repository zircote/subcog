# ADR-0051: Feature-Gate Org-Scope Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The original architecture included an org-scope tier for shared PostgreSQL storage across teams. This enables:
- Shared decisions across organization
- Centralized backup and compliance
- Team knowledge aggregation

## Decision

We will **include org-scope in the design, but feature-gate the implementation**.

```rust
// config/features.rs
pub struct FeatureFlags {
    pub org_scope_enabled: bool,  // Default: false
    // ...
}
```

The architecture supports org-scope but it's disabled by default. When enabled:
- Requires PostgreSQL connection configuration
- Sync behavior TBD (push-only, pull-only, bidirectional)
- Admin controls for namespace visibility

## Consequences

### Positive

- Future-proofs the architecture
- No immediate implementation burden
- Can be enabled when demand materializes

### Negative

- Design complexity for unused feature
- May need redesign when actually implemented

## Decision Outcome

Feature-gating allows the architecture to evolve without immediate implementation burden.

Mitigations:
- Keep org-scope interfaces minimal and abstract
- Document intended behavior in ARCHITECTURE.md

## Audit

**Date:** 2026-01-04

**Finding:** ✅ **COMPLIANT**

**Remediation Completed:** 2026-01-04

**Evidence:**
- `src/config/features.rs` lines 1-66: FeatureFlags struct definition
  - **Missing:** `pub org_scope_enabled: bool` field specified in this ADR
  - **Present fields:** secrets_filter, pii_filter, multi_domain, audit_log, llm_features, auto_capture, consolidation
  - No org-scope feature gate exists

**Comment:** The org-scope feature flag was never implemented. The FeatureFlags struct omits the `org_scope_enabled` field entirely, meaning org-scope cannot be toggled at runtime as the ADR design specifies. This prevents safe rollout of org-scope features and makes it impossible to disable org-scope in environments where it's not needed.

**Remediation Completed:**
1. ✅ Added `pub org_scope_enabled: bool` to FeatureFlags (`src/config/features.rs:22`)
2. ✅ Set default to `false` in all constructors (none/core/all)
3. ✅ Field available for environment variable configuration
4. ✅ Feature flag in place for future org-scope initialization
5. ✅ Ready for org-scope implementation when needed
