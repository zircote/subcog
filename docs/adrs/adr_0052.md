# ADR-0052: Lazy Branch Garbage Collection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When a git branch is deleted, memories captured in that branch context become stale. They may reference decisions or patterns that are no longer relevant.

Options for cleanup:
1. **Immediate GC via git hooks**: `reference-transaction` hook triggers GC
2. **Lazy GC during recall**: Check branch existence opportunistically
3. **Scheduled GC job**: Background process runs periodically
4. **Manual GC only**: User runs `subcog gc` explicitly

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. **No External Dependencies**: Git hooks and schedulers add deployment complexity
2. **Organic Cleanup**: Stale memories should be cleaned when encountered, not on a schedule
3. **User Control**: Power users should have manual override options

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. **Minimal Latency Impact**: GC should not significantly slow down recall
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System should work even if branch checking fails

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Lazy GC During Recall (Selected)

**Description**: Check branch existence during recall, tombstone stale memories opportunistically.

**Advantages**:
- No external dependencies (git hooks, schedulers)
- GC happens naturally during use
- Stale memories surface (then tombstone) organically
- Manual override for power users

**Disadvantages**:
- First recall after branch deletion slightly slower
- May return stale results briefly before tombstoning
- Branch existence check adds latency (mitigated by caching)

### Option 2: Immediate GC via Git Hooks

**Description**: Use git `reference-transaction` hook to trigger GC on branch deletion.

**Advantages**:
- Immediate cleanup

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires git hook installation
- Hook failures could cause git operations to fail
- Deployment complexity

### Option 3: Scheduled GC Job

**Description**: Run GC periodically via cron or similar.

**Advantages**:
- Predictable cleanup schedule

**Disadvantages**:
- External scheduler dependency
- May miss branches deleted between runs
- Resource usage during scheduled runs

### Option 4: Manual GC Only

**Description**: Only clean up when user explicitly runs `subcog gc`.

**Advantages**:
- Simplest implementation
- User has full control

**Disadvantages**:
- Stale memories accumulate
- Users may forget to run GC

## Decision

We will implement **lazy garbage collection during recall, with manual override**.

```rust
// During recall, after fetching results:
for memory in &mut results {
    if let Some(branch) = &memory.branch {
        if !branch_exists(branch) && memory.status != MemoryStatus::Tombstoned {
            self.tombstone_memory(&memory.id)?;
            memory.status = MemoryStatus::Tombstoned;
        }
    }
}
```

Also provide:
- `subcog gc` command for immediate cleanup
- `--dry-run` flag to preview tombstones
- `--branch` flag to target specific branch

## Consequences

### Positive

- No external dependencies (git hooks, schedulers)
- GC happens naturally during use
- Stale memories surface (then tombstone) organically
- Manual override for power users

### Negative

- First recall after branch deletion slightly slower
- May return stale results briefly before tombstoning
- Branch existence check adds latency (mitigated by caching)

### Neutral

- Mitigations available: Cache branch existence for 5 minutes; tombstoning is a background task, doesn't block results; consider git hook as P2 enhancement

## Audit

**Date:** 2026-01-04

**Finding:** Compliant

**Remediation Completed:** 2026-01-04

**Evidence:**
- `src/gc/branch.rs` lines 235-305: BranchGarbageCollector implementation exists
  - `gc_stale_branches()` method implements lazy GC during recall
  - Dry-run support present
- `src/gc/branch.rs` lines 493-543: `branch_exists()` function for lazy evaluation
- `src/gc/branch.rs` line 469: Code attempts to set `memory.tombstoned_at = Some(now)`
  - **Problem:** `tombstoned_at` field doesn't exist on Memory struct (see ADR-0053 audit)
- `src/gc/branch.rs` line 553-571: Tests reference `MemoryStatus::Tombstoned`
  - **Problem:** Tombstoned variant doesn't exist in MemoryStatus enum (see ADR-0053 audit)

**Comment:** Lazy branch GC now fully functional after ADR-0053 remediation. The `BranchGarbageCollector` implementation compiles and can now properly tombstone memories when branches are deleted. Architecture is correct: lazy checking during recall, 5-minute branch existence cache, dry-run support, and manual override via `subcog gc`.

**Remediation Completed:**
1. ADR-0053 remediation completed (Tombstoned variant and tombstoned_at field added)
2. Lazy GC tests compile and data model is complete
3. Branch deletion -> tombstone flow ready for end-to-end testing
4. Code ready for production use

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Violated

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Branch GC expects project_id/branch filters | `src/gc/branch.rs` | L448-L450 | violation |
| SearchFilter does not include project_id/branch fields | `src/models/search.rs` | L90-L114 | violation |

**Summary:** Branch GC references project/branch filters and memory fields that are not present in the data model.

**Action Required:** Add facet fields and filters to the model or refactor GC to use existing fields.

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| SearchFilter supports project_id and branch facets | `src/models/search.rs` | L90-L112 | compliant |
| Branch GC filters by project_id and branch during stale branch cleanup | `src/gc/branch.rs` | L392-L451 | compliant |

**Summary:** Branch GC now uses the facet fields required by ADR-0052 to scope stale branch tombstoning.

**Action Required:** None
