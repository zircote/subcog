# ADR-0054: Notification Detection via `id` Field Absence

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to distinguish between JSON-RPC requests (which expect responses) and notifications (which must not receive responses). The JSON-RPC 2.0 specification defines this distinction.

## Decision

We will detect notifications by checking if the `id` field is absent (`None`) in the parsed `JsonRpcRequest`. This is the canonical method per JSON-RPC 2.0 spec.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simple, spec-compliant detection
- No changes to `JsonRpcRequest` struct needed
- Works for all notification types, not just known ones

### Negative

- None identified

### Neutral

- Relies on serde correctly parsing missing `id` as `None`

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Check method name prefix** (`notifications/*`): Not reliable - other protocols may use different conventions, and it's not what the spec says.

2. **Maintain allowlist of notification methods**: Over-engineered for this use case and requires maintenance.

## Decision Outcome

Using `id` field absence is the canonical JSON-RPC 2.0 approach and requires minimal code changes.

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| JsonRpcRequest::is_notification checks id is None | `src/mcp/server.rs` | L1025-L1041 | compliant |

**Summary:** Notifications are detected by missing id in JsonRpcRequest.

**Action Required:** None
