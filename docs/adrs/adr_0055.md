# ADR-0055: Empty String Return for Notification Responses

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When a notification is received, we need to signal to the caller that no response should be sent. We need a mechanism that works with the existing code structure.

## Decision

We will return an empty string (`String::new()`) from `process_request()` for notifications. The caller checks `if !response.is_empty()` before writing to stdout.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Minimal code change
- Clear semantics (empty = nothing to send)
- No changes to return type signature

### Negative

- Caller must remember to check for empty string
- Empty string could theoretically be a valid response (but isn't in JSON-RPC)

### Neutral

- Alternative would be `Option<String>` return type, but that's a larger refactor

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Return `Option<String>`**: Cleaner semantically, but requires changing all callers and the function signature.

2. **Throw/return error**: Incorrect - notifications are valid messages, not errors.

3. **Set a flag on the server**: Stateful and error-prone.

## Decision Outcome

Empty string return provides a simple sentinel value that integrates with existing code patterns.

## Audit

### 2026-01-04

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| handle_request returns empty string for notifications | `src/mcp/server.rs` | L623-L692 | compliant |

**Summary:** Stdio notifications return an empty response string.

**Action Required:** None
