# ADR-0056: Always Include `id` in Error Responses

## Status

Accepted

## Context

JSON-RPC 2.0 requires the `id` field in all response objects, including error responses. The current implementation uses `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` which omits `id` when it's `None`.

## Decision

We will modify `format_error()` to always include `id`. When the original request's `id` is unknown (e.g., parse errors), use `Value::Null` explicitly.

```rust
id: Some(id.unwrap_or(Value::Null))
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Compliant with JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
- Clients can parse error responses correctly
- Minimal code change (one line)

### Negative

- None identified

### Neutral

- Success responses can continue to omit `id` if `None` (though this shouldn't happen in practice for valid requests)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Create separate `JsonRpcErrorResponse` struct**: Over-engineered; the fix is one line.

2. **Remove `skip_serializing_if` globally**: Would affect success responses unnecessarily.

## Decision Outcome

A targeted fix to `format_error()` ensures spec compliance with minimal code change.
