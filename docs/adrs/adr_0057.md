# ADR-0057: HTTP Transport Returns 204 for Notifications

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the HTTP transport, we need to decide what HTTP response to send for notifications. Since no JSON-RPC response body is appropriate, we need an HTTP status that conveys "received, no content."

## Decision

We will return **HTTP 204 No Content** for notifications over HTTP transport.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Semantically correct (the notification was received, there's no content to return)
- Standard HTTP practice
- Clients won't try to parse an empty body as JSON

### Negative

- Some clients might expect 200 OK for all successful operations

### Neutral

- Could alternatively return 200 with empty body, but 204 is more explicit

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Return 200 OK with empty body**: Valid, but less semantically precise.

2. **Return 200 OK with `{}` body**: Misleading - suggests there was a response.

## Decision Outcome

HTTP 204 No Content is the most semantically appropriate status for successful notifications.
