# ADR-0058: Debug-Level Logging for Notifications

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need observability into notification handling without creating log noise in production.

## Decision

We will log notifications at `debug` level with the method name. Add a counter metric `mcp_notifications_total` with method label.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Observability for debugging
- Metrics for monitoring notification volume
- No log noise at info/warn levels

### Negative

- Debug logs may be verbose in development

### Neutral

- Consistent with existing logging patterns in the codebase

## Decision Outcome

Debug-level logging provides sufficient observability without impacting production log volume.
