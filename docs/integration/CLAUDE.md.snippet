## Subcog Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

At the start of EVERY session, call `subcog_init` to load memory context and best practices.

During the session:
- **Before implementing**: Recall relevant decisions and patterns
- **Capture immediately**: When decisions, patterns, learnings, or fixes are identified
- Access Subcog only via MCP tools, never shell commands
