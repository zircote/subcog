Event bus for cross-component communication using tokio broadcast channels. Components subscribe to MemoryEvent variants (MemoryCaptured, SearchCompleted, SyncCompleted) and react asynchronously. Benefits: loose coupling, easy addition of handlers, centralized event logging, testable in isolation. Trade-offs: eventual consistency (async), debugging event chains. This is ADR-004.
